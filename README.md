I implemented a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method using BERT and MPNet models, exploring various techniques such as dot product, cosine similarity, k-NN, and Mahalanobis distance for document retrieval based on a query. Evaluation metrics like Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Precision@k, Recall@k, and Mean Average Precision (MAP) were used to assess performance. The cosine similarity method with the MPNet model yielded the best results, achieving metrics of {'MRR': 0.6783333333333333, 'nDCG': 0.7553719362932098, 'Precision at 3': 0.2666666666666667, 'Recall at 3': 0.75, 'MAP': 0.67}. The MS MARCO dataset from Hugging Face and models from the same platform were utilized in the process.
